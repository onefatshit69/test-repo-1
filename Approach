The idea is :
We need to find structures like this: A-B-C-D-E so we consider C as our starting point and C should have at least 2 neighbors otherwise there will be no such structure from node C .
Now if C is having at least 2 neighbors then we traverse through the neighbors of C (nodes attached to C) and check if the neighbors are having more than 1 neighbor (nodes attached to C's neighbors) otherwise there won't be any structure possible.

Pseudocode :
result=0
loop from i=1 to n
   check if the ith node is having more than 1 neighbors
   if yes 
      traverse the neighbors and check if their neighbors are more than 1
      if yes
         push the size of neighbors of neighbors of C  - 1 into a vector
      
       result+= Sum of product of all pairs of vector elements
return result
